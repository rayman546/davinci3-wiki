# Davinci3 Wiki: Action Plan for Remaining Tasks

## Overview
This action plan addresses the remaining tasks from the code quality audit, prioritizing high-impact and high-priority items. The plan is organized into four implementation weeks with specific tasks and deliverables.

## Priority 1: Frontend Error Handling (Flutter UI)

- [x] **Implement Missing Error Logging Functionality**
  - [x] Add `logError` method to `ApiErrorHandler` class
  - [x] Implement console logging for development
  - [x] Add persistent logging for production
  - [x] Add toast notification option for user-visible errors

- [ ] **Audit and Standardize Error Handling**
  - [ ] Review all pages for consistent error handling patterns
  - [ ] Update any components not using `ApiErrorHandler`
  - [ ] Ensure all UI components display error states appropriately
  - [ ] Verify offline state handling across all pages

- [ ] **Enhance Error Recovery Options**
  - [ ] Add retry functionality with exponential backoff to all error states
  - [ ] Implement offline queue for operations that can be retried when connection returns
  - [ ] Add manual refresh options where appropriate

- [ ] **Test Error Handling**
  - [x] Create test cases for common error scenarios (404, 500, timeout, offline)
  - [ ] Test error recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Test offline behavior and recovery

## Priority 2: Additional Security Measures

- [x] **Implement Rate Limiting**
  - [x] Add request frequency tracking middleware
  - [x] Define appropriate rate limits for different API endpoints

  - [x] Add appropriate response headers for rate-limited requests
  - [x] Test rate limiting under various load conditions

- [x] **Add Input Validation**
  - [x] Review all API endpoints for input validation needs
  - [x] Implement validation for search endpoints (query parameters, sanitization)
  - [x] Add validation for LLM question answering endpoints
  - [x] Create consistent error responses for validation failures
  - [x] Test with invalid inputs to verify proper handling

- [x] **Document Security Measures**
  - [x] Update API documentation with rate limiting details
  - [x] Document input validation requirements
  - [x] Create security guidelines for contributors

## Priority 3: Testing Enhancements

- [ ] **Set Up Integration Test Framework**
  - [ ] Configure test environment for combined frontend/backend testing
  - [ ] Create fixture data for integration tests
  - [ ] Implement test utilities for API interactions
  - [ ] Define integration test coverage goals

- [ ] **Implement API Endpoint Tests**
  - [ ] Create test cases for article retrieval endpoints
  - [ ] Implement tests for search functionality
  - [ ] Add tests for semantic search
  - [ ] Create tests for LLM integration
  - [ ] Implement performance benchmarks for key operations

- [ ] **Define LLM Testing Strategy**
  - [ ] Create deterministic LLM mock for unit testing
  - [ ] Define approach for balancing mocked and real LLM tests
  - [ ] Implement test suite for LLM-dependent features
  - [ ] Document expected behavior and test coverage

## Priority 4: Web Scraper Testing and Validation

- [x] **Create Benchmark Framework**
  - [x] Implement timing instrumentation for web scraper operations
  - [x] Create scripts to measure memory and CPU usage
  - [x] Develop test datasets with 10, 50, 100, and 200 URLs
  - [x] Set up automated benchmark execution

- [x] **Perform Load Testing**
  - [x] Test with increasing concurrency levels
  - [x] Monitor resource usage under load
  - [x] Identify and document bottlenecks
  - [x] Establish resource usage guidelines

- [x] **Validate Error Handling**
  - [x] Test with deliberately invalid URLs
  - [x] Test with URLs that timeout or return errors
  - [x] Verify proper cleanup of resources after errors
  - [x] Ensure errors in one URL don't affect others

## Priority 5: Rust Dependency Management

- [ ] **Review Dependencies**
  - [ ] Audit Cargo.lock for loose version constraints
  - [ ] Check for outdated dependencies
  - [ ] Verify for known security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Test build reproducibility with locked versions

- [ ] **Create Dependency Management Documentation**
  - [ ] Document process for updating Rust dependencies
  - [ ] Add guidelines for version specifications
  - [ ] Create step-by-step instructions for regenerating Cargo.lock
  - [ ] Document handling of breaking changes

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Frontend Error Handling & Security Foundations
- Implement missing `logError` method in ApiErrorHandler ✅
- Audit all UI pages for consistent error handling
- Review Cargo.lock for immediate security concerns
- Begin implementing rate limiting middleware ✅

### Week 2: Security Measures & Testing Framework
- Complete input validation for critical endpoints ✅
- Finish rate limiting implementation ✅
- Document security measures in API documentation and developer guide ✅
- Set up integration test framework
- Begin implementation of API endpoint tests

### Week 3: Web Scraper Testing & LLM Strategy
- Create web scraper benchmark framework ✅
- Implement initial benchmarks and load tests ✅
- Define and document LLM testing strategy
- Continue implementation of API endpoint tests

### Week 4: Finalization & Documentation
- Complete all remaining implementation tasks
- Finalize testing across all components
- Complete all documentation updates
- Perform final code review and cleanup

## Success Criteria

- **Frontend Error Handling**: All error cases are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages and recovery options
- **Security Measures**: System is protected against common attack vectors with proper rate limiting and input validation ✅
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covers all critical functionality with clear pass/fail criteria
- **Web Scraper**: Performance characteristics are well-documented with established resource usage guidelines ✅
- **Dependency Management**: Clear documentation exists for maintaining and updating dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Continue with frontend error handling by auditing all UI pages for consistent error handling
2. Begin setting up the integration test framework
3. Start looking into Rust dependency management
