# Davinci3 Wiki: Remaining Tasks Action Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining tasks needed to fully address the issues identified in our previous code quality audit. While significant progress has been made in error handling, concurrency control, dependency management, and security, several important tasks remain to complete the implementation.

## 1. Frontend Error Handling (Flutter UI)

- [ ] **Audit Current Flutter UI Error Handling**
  - [ ] Locate Flutter UI code in the project structure
  - [ ] Identify all API interaction points
  - [ ] Document current error handling approaches

- [ ] **Implement Centralized Error Handling**
  - [ ] Create `ApiErrorHandler` class in Flutter codebase
  - [ ] Implement methods for handling different error types (4xx, 5xx, connectivity)
  - [ ] Add user-friendly message generation based on error types
  - [ ] Implement localization support for error messages

- [ ] **Standardize Error Handling Across UI**
  - [ ] Update all API calls to use the centralized error handler
  - [ ] Add loading states and error states to all screens
  - [ ] Implement retry functionality for failed requests
  - [ ] Add offline detection and appropriate UI feedback

- [ ] **Test Error Handling**
  - [ ] Create test cases for various error scenarios
  - [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
  - [ ] Test offline behavior and recovery

## 2. Web Scraper Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Create Benchmark Framework**
  - [ ] Implement timing instrumentation for web scraper operations
  - [ ] Create scripts to measure memory and CPU usage
  - [ ] Develop representative test datasets with various URL counts

- [ ] **Perform Comparative Benchmarks**
  - [ ] Measure performance of original implementation (if possible)
  - [ ] Benchmark new asyncio implementation with same datasets
  - [ ] Document performance improvements or regressions

- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - [ ] Test with increasing numbers of concurrent URLs (10, 50, 100, 200)
  - [ ] Monitor resource usage under load
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks or memory leaks
  - [ ] Establish resource usage guidelines

- [ ] **Error Handling Validation**
  - [ ] Test with deliberately invalid URLs
  - [ ] Test with URLs that timeout or return errors
  - [ ] Verify proper cleanup of resources after errors
  - [ ] Ensure errors in one URL don't affect others

## 3. Rust Dependency Management

- [ ] **Review Cargo.lock**
  - [ ] Examine all dependencies and their version specifications
  - [ ] Identify any dependencies with loose version constraints
  - [ ] Check for outdated dependencies or security issues
  - [ ] Verify build reproducibility with locked versions

- [ ] **Create Dependency Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Document process for updating Rust dependencies
  - [ ] Add guidelines for version specifications
  - [ ] Create step-by-step instructions for regenerating Cargo.lock
  - [ ] Include best practices for handling breaking changes

- [ ] **Implement Dependency Review Workflow**
  - [ ] Create guidelines for regular dependency reviews
  - [ ] Document how to check for security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Define process for testing after dependency updates
  - [ ] Add dependency update strategy to developer documentation

## 4. Additional Security Measures

- [ ] **Implement Rate Limiting**
  - [ ] Add middleware support for tracking request frequency
  - [ ] Define rate limits for different API endpoints
  - [ ] Implement token bucket or sliding window rate limiting algorithm
  - [ ] Add appropriate response headers and status codes for rate-limited requests
  - [ ] Document rate limiting behavior for API consumers

- [ ] **Add Input Validation**
  - [ ] Review all API endpoints for input validation needs
  - [ ] Implement validation for query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies
  - [ ] Add consistent error responses for validation failures
  - [ ] Document validation requirements in API documentation

- [ ] **Authentication Options**
  - [ ] Research authentication mechanisms appropriate for the API
  - [ ] Implement pluggable authentication system
  - [ ] Add API key or JWT token support
  - [ ] Create configuration options for enabling/disabling authentication
  - [ ] Document authentication setup and usage

## 5. Testing Enhancements

- [ ] **Integration Test Framework**
  - [ ] Set up integration test environment for backend and frontend
  - [ ] Create fixture data for integration tests
  - [ ] Implement test utilities for API interactions
  - [ ] Define integration test scope and coverage goals

- [ ] **API Endpoint Testing**
  - [ ] Create test cases for each major API endpoint
  - [ ] Test successful operations and error scenarios
  - [ ] Test edge cases (pagination, filtering, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement performance testing for key endpoints

- [ ] **LLM Testing Strategy**
  - [ ] Define approach for balancing mocked and real LLM tests
  - [ ] Implement deterministic LLM mocks for unit tests
  - [ ] Create real LLM test suite for periodic validation
  - [ ] Document expected behavior and test coverage

- [ ] **Testing Documentation**
  - [ ] Update testing guide with new testing categories
  - [ ] Add examples for writing integration tests
  - [ ] Document LLM mocking approach
  - [ ] Create CI/CD integration guidelines for tests
